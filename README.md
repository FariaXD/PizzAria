 Development of a restaurant application using Android Studio Kotlin.

 The application is a food delivering service in which the user can add food to his/her cart and purchase them.
 It was developed for the course Development of Mobile Applications in Computer Science and Multimedia in ISEL.

 It uses Firebase to collect food images and user accounts via cloud.

 A serverside application in which the restaurant employers can accept orders was planned but not developed via professor recommendation and because of time.

 The app was developed using Kotlin.
